This repository contains the GEN_AI.ipynb and the spam_mail_classifier.csv files. The GEN_AI.ipynb file containd the jupyter notebook code that loads a pre-trained BERT model for sequence classification tasks and is fine-tuned to work on the dataset contained in spam_mail_classifier.csv from Kaggle.




It calulates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score from the scikit-learn library to measure the performance of the model.
